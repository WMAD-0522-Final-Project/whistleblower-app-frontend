## Ground rules

### GIT

#### Branch

- Make sure you are on `dev` branch when making a new branch
- Make a branch for each feature or task
  - Example
    - `navigation-menu`
    - `header`
- OR pull `dev` branch into your branch frequently to avoid merge conflicts

`git merge dev`

#### Commit message

- Start with a verb
  - Example
    - `add navigation menu`
    - `fix header responsiveness`
